The way of a man with a woman

    What is the way of a man with a woman?  Can it be taught?  Man is masculine.
    Woman is feminine.  The core essence of masculinity is power.
    Of femininity: beauty.  It is above all else a woman's beauty that catches
    a man's attention, and it is above all a man's power that impresses a woman.
